# Iris Classification with PyTorch

A simple neural network model built with PyTorch to classify Iris flowers based on their features.

## Dataset
Using the classic [Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset) which includes three species of Iris flowers with their measurements.

## Project Structure
- `model.py` - Neural Network model definition
- `training.py` - Training script for the model
- `data_sets.py` - Dataset handling and preprocessing
- `load_model.test.py` - Script to test the trained model
- `iris-ann.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with model development and visualization
- `iris.csv` - Dataset file
- `iris-ann.pt` - Trained model weights

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Run `training.py` to train the model
2. Use `load_model.test.py` to test the trained model
3. Check `iris-ann.ipynb` for detailed analysis and visualizations
